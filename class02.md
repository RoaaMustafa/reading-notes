### HTML

  - Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
  - Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the

  ### JS
  
 
 1.  A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.  `<script></script> `
2. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered  creating a calculation using that value.
3. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
4. Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
5. Expressions evaluate into a single value.
6. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
