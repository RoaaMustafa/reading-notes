 # Javascript and JQuery
 ## Summary about what I read
 basics of the JavaScript
language.
A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OFINSTRUCTIONS
 Designing A script , make a viewchart of the tasks
• Vocabulary: The words that computersunderstand
• Syntax: How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow
You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them.
RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES:
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).
CREATING AN ARRAY 
VALUES IN ARRAYS
ACCESSING & CHANGING VALUES IN AN ARRAY
EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE: var color = 'beige';
EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE: var area = 3 * 2;
