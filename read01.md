I Knew what is the text editor is and how it can help the programmer to write codes and
allows him to write and manage text. Like notepad ++, Visual Studio Code is a text editor, Atom and Brackets are also text editors.

The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs:

Text Editors: it edits text and manages text and manages files.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment): it is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package
Also, I learned about a new terminal tool and some basics commands:

pwd :(print working directory to  show when I am now),
ls: (list the things that I have in my folder/to see what is inside the folder)
clear:( To clear previous commands)
mkdir :( to create a new folder)
cd:( to get back from directory/ folder)
touch : (to create a file inside a specific folder/directory)
