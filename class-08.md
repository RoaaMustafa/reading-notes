## Layout
* **WHY?** ayout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the     other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window. 
* **Controlling the Position of Elements** :allow you to control the layout of a page: **normal flow**, **relative positioning**, and **absolute positioning.**
* **positioning schemes:**
       1. Normal flow: each item to appear lower down the page `position:static`
       2. Relative Positioning: shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it `position:relative`
       3. Absolute positioning: ignore the space it would have taken up, top right, and the paragraphs start at the top of the screen `position:absolute`
       4. Fixed Positioning:stays in the exact same place. `position:fixed` 
       5. Floating Elements : `float: right;`; `clear`;`left;`;`none`;`both`
       6. Overflapping elements: `z-index`
       
     * Creating Multi-Column Layouts with Floats: `width`;` float`;` margin`.
  * **Screen Sizes**
     * Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to  work on a range o              different sized screens.
     * Screen Resolution: the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust      the resolution of their screens
     * Page Sizes : screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much.
         1. Fixed Width Layouts: designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
         2. Liquid Layouts: stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
  * **Layout Grids**:
     * **WHAT?** Grids set consistent proportions and spaces between items 
     * **WHY?**  helps to create a professional looking design.
  * **CSS Frameworks** 
    * WHY ?
