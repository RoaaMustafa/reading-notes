### Readings: Introduction to React and Components
+ A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

+ Characteristics of Components:
   Reusability
   Replaceable
   Not context specific
   Extensible
   Encapsulated
   Independent 
   
+ dvantages of using component based architecture:
   Ease of deployment 
   Reduced cost
   Ease of development
   Reusable
   Modification of technical complexity
   Reliability
   System maintenance and evolution
   Independent
   
+ “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
+  How to Use Props in React : 
      1. define an attribute and its value(data) ----- `interpolation { }:`
      2. pass it to child component(s) by using Props ------ `=>`
      3.  render the Props Data -------by using string interpolation: `{props}`
+ Props data is immutable (read-only)

+ React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
+ three React components:

Square
Board
Game

+ React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to `ReactDOM.render().`

+ We call ReactDOM.render() 
+ React callsthe component as the props
+ Our  component returns a element as the result.
+ React DOM efficiently updates the DOM
