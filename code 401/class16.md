#### What it is and why it matters

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data,
identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

#### What's required to create good machine learning systems?

Data preparation capabilities.

Algorithms – basic and advanced.

Automation and iterative processes.

Scalability.

Ensemble modeling.

#### Key Terminology

+ Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
+ Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
+ Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
+ Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
+ Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
+ Target variable - A specific variable you’re trying to predict.
+ Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

#### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning includes tasks for “labeled” data 

 it’s often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.

Each observation must be labeled with a “correct answer.”

Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what’s “correct” while training it 

Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.

Classification is the task for modeling categorical target variable

#### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning includes tasks for “unlabeled” data

In practice, it’s often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.

Unlabeled data has no predetermined “correct answer.”

You’ll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without “supervision”).

Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it’s for finding groups within your data.

### Three elements of great machine learning

+ A skilled chef (Human guidance) - First, even though we are “teaching computers to learn on their own,” human guidance plays a huge role.

+ Fresh ingredients (Clean relative data) - The second essential element is the quality of your data.

+ Don’t overcook it (Avoid overfitting) - An overfit model has “memorized” the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true underlying patterns.

#### The Blueprint

Our machine learning blueprint is designed around those 3 elements.

### There are 5 core steps:

##### Exploratory Analysis
First, “get to know” the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.

##### Data Cleaning
Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms.

##### Feature Engineering
Next, help your algorithms “focus” on what’s important by creating new features.

##### Algorithm Selection
Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.

##### Model Training
Finally, train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you’ve done the first 4.

## Data Cleaning
Remove Unwanted observations

#### The first step to data cleaning is removing unwanted observations from your dataset.

This includes duplicate or irrelevant observations.

#### Duplicate observations

Duplicate observations most frequently arise during data collection, such as when you:

+ Combine datasets from multiple places

+ Scrape data

+ Receive data from clients/other departments

+ Irrelevant observations





#### Did you know?

In machine learning, a target is called a label.

In statistics, a target is called a dependent variable.

A variable in statistics is called a feature in machine learning.

A transformation in statistics is called feature creation in machine learning.


##### Deep learning

Deep learning combines advances in computing power and special types of neural networks to learn complicated patterns in large amounts of data. 

Deep learning techniques are currently state of the art for identifying objects in images and words in sounds. 

Researchers are now looking to apply these successes in pattern recognition to more complex tasks such as automatic language translation, medical diagnoses and numerous other important social and business problems.

#### How it works


Algorithms: SAS graphical user interfaces help you build machine learning models and implement an iterative machine learning process. 

You don't have to be an advanced statistician. Our comprehensive selection of machine learning algorithms can help you quickly get value from your big data and are included in many SAS products.
