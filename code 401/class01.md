### [Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

+ All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain.

+ As you experience pain, seek the remedy! Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do.

+ You’re here because you chose to invest in a different life. A better life.

### [Beginners Guide to Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 

Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

+ O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

+ Big-O-notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

+ Can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.

+ represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set

+ O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.

+ big-Θ notation bounds the running time from both above and below, rather than just from above.
