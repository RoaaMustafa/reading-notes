## Linear Regressions

### [How to Run Linear Regression in Python](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)
#### Linear Regression
+ Linear Regression is a technique to create mathematical model represents a best fit for data set
+ we can use numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn for linear regression.
+ Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning.

+ It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.
Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Underfitting and Overfitting

#### The first step is to import the required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook.

#### Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:

`lm.fit() `-> fits a linear model

`lm.predict()` -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients

`lm.score() `-> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). 
#### Predicting Prices
using lm.predict
