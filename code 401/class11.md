## Readings: Data Analysis

### [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)
+ JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

+ JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner

+ JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats.
+ JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.)

+ You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. 
+ Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing

### [NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

#### What ?

1- **NumPy** stands for Numerical Python.
   it a third party module to deal with arrays and Matrices
   open source 
2- is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. 
3- Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.

4- **NumPy** is a commonly used Python data analysis package. 
5- By using **NumPy**, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. 
**NumPy** was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. 

6- With **NumPy**, we can work with multidimensional arrays.
7- NumPy makes it simple to perform mathematical operations on arrays. 
8- and makes it quite easy to do computations.

9- the core of NumPy is written in a programming language called C, which stores data differently than the Python data types.
10 **NumPy** data types map between Python and C, allowing us to use NumPy arrays without any conversion hitches.

#### Why ?
- consume less memory 
- very fast comared to python list
- support element Wise operation (binary operation)
- elements are stored Contiguous
