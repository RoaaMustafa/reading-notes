## [Whiteboard Advice](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a)

### 1- Communicate! :
The best advice I have received is to communicate. if I in the interview and the interviewers throw you a whiteboard question. the first thing I should make sur that I undersatand the problem Do I understand what they’re asking ME to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. I might actually be surprised to find I didnt understand what they’re asking for  perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

### 2- Restate the Question

### 3- Ask About Edge Cases
I should Think for a bit about the inputs and output and think about edge cases to the problem and Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer didnt even thought about edge cases and will make something up.

### 4- Ask About Test Cases
This is free and I should take benefit of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function must pass it

### 5- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
Write Pseudocode and Check the Logic I don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language Before I check it .

### 6- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

### 7- Stuck? Ask for Help!

### 8- Communicating Prior to the Interview
### 9- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
### 10- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good


## [7 tips to ace a programming interview](https://medium.com/@steve_45636/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)

### 1-  Take a few minutes.

Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer:
**“Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”**

Don’t forget to provide your reasoning!
**So, I think that, since the array is sorted, it makes the most sense to do something like a binary search here. Here are the general steps that I think are involved in the solution: …”
**
### 2-  Write down the steps of the solution.

+ Start at middle of array.
+ Keep variables tracking left and right boundaries of search area.
+ If value equal to search_val, return true.
+ If left and right boundaries are adjacent, return false.
+ If value bigger than search_val, go halfway towards left boundary, and move the right boundary along with us.
+ If value smaller than search_val, go halfway towards right boundary, and move the left boundary along with us.

### 3- Write pseudocode first.
### 4- Don’t sweat the small stuff.
### 5- Sit down. Be humble.
### 6- Come prepared.
### 7- Review your work.

Happy job hunting!
