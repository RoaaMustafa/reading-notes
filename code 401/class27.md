# Django Models

 Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc.

  Django allows you to define relationships that are one to one (**OneToOneField**), one to many (**ForeignKey**) and many to many (**ManyToManyField**).
  
  the UML association diagram below shows the models :
