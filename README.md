# Growth Mindset
# Introduction:
_***A growth mindset contrasts with a fixed mindsetâ€”the limiting belief that such capacities cannot be meaningfully developed. Proponents of the theory contend that adopting a growth mindset, and rejecting a fixed mindset, can make students and others more likely to succeed. They propose that individuals with a growth mindset will be more oriented toward self-improvement and more likely to persist in the face of challenges and failures because they will treat them as opportunities to grow rather than signs that their abilities are inadequate.***_
