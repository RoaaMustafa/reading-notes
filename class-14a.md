# Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

I read about Transform property it is usefull in css to reposition and set amovement to the elements : 
+ **rotate**-provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees ,
+  **scale**-allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.
+  **translate** :translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.
+  **skew**: is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. 
Also the transition property and there are many popular transitional properties include the following:
background,colorbackground-positionborder,color,border,widthborder ,spacingbottom , clip  ,color ,crop  ,font ,sizefont,  weightheight, and more .
Also there are properity called :hover it's usefull to buuton styling.
