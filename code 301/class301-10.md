### [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

**1. What is a ‘call’?**
is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

**2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**
only one function can happen.

**3. What does LIFO mean?**
it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

     function b() {
    console.log("Hello World!")
    };
     function a() {
       b();
     };
       a();
       const i;
       
**4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

**5. What causes a Stack Overflow?**

when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.


### [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

**1. What is a ‘refrence error’?**

when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared

**2. What is a ‘syntax error’?**

when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

**3. What is a ‘range error’?**

Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length

**4. What is a ‘tyep error’?**

when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

**5. What is a breakpoint?**
it is a point to stop the code when the execution reaches it.

**6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**

to let you  see the “history” before reaching that breakpoint.
