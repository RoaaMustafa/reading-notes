### 1.In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

**100’s = **

Informational status codes; To tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. 

**200’s =**

The success codes. To tell the client that its request was accepted. 
 
 **300’s =**

 Redirection codes. To tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore. 
 
 **400’s =**

Client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server.

There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, etc. 

**500’s =**

the server error codes. Often they indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes they can be directly
related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server. 

These errors can be temporary or permanent. Usually it’s best for the client to 
retry the same request.


### 2.What is a status code 202?

Accepted - Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future. 

### 3.What is a status code 308?
Permanent Redirect - This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. 

### 4.What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

204 No Content.

### 5.What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

410 Gone.

### 6.What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

### 1.Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

We want to put something there that is not localhost and to protect our information.

### 2.What is middleware?

Code that runs but before it gets to your routes.

### 3.What does app.use(express.json()) do?

Allows the server to accept json as a body inside an http method element.

### 4.What does the /:id mean in a route?

The : in front of id means that it is a parameter. Gives access to whatever the user passes in.

### 5.What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?

PUT to replace something

PATCH to update only the information that needs updating, not complete replacement.

### 6.How do you make a defalut value in a schema?

 object as a key value pair with the key most likely being default:. In the example used in the video, it was default: Date.now.
 
### 7.What does a 500 error status code mean?

Internal server error. Generic error, but indicates that there is a problem with the server.

### 8.What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

 200 - request received and is processing.
 
 201 - request received, was successful, and has result of created resource.
