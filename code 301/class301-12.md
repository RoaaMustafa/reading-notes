### 1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment 

### 2. Give a real world example.

MySQL database is very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP.
By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application

### 3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries

### 4. Give a real world example.

Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents.

### 5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

### 6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic
