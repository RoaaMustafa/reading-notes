HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.

What I learned from chapter 17 

 HTML5: indicates the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code.
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
What I learned from chapter 8

Flash allows you to add animations, video, and audio to
the web. Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad.
HTML5 introduces new (video) and (audio)
elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but
these are only supported in the latest browsers.
 Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not
all support the same video and audio formats, so you
need to supply your files in different formats to ensure
that everyone can see/hear them.
