## State and Props

#### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

render first then componentDidMount

#### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

The **constructor** for a React component is called before it is mounted.

#### Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

1. constructor
2.  render
3. componentDidMount
4.  React Updates
5.  componentWillUnmount


#### What does componentDidMount do?

+ Used for DOM mainupolation and network requests.
+ It is invoked  after a component is mounted.
+ It is a good place to set up any subscriptions.
+ setState() can be called here, but it should be used sparingly.

## how to include React Bootstrap in the project

+ Installation: `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@4.6.0`
+ Importing Components:` import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';

// or less ideally
import { Button } from 'react-bootstra`
+ Browser globals:`<script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>

<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"
  crossorigin></script>

<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/react-bootstrap@next/dist/react-bootstrap.min.js"
  crossorigin></script>

<script>var Alert = ReactBootstrap.Alert;</script>`

+ CSS: `{/* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file*/}

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';`

## React State Vs Props

+ What types of things can you pass in the props?
 props used  to display things, like argument to function
 
+ What is the big difference between props and state?
props: pass it to the component----> updated outside the component
state: it’s inside the component---->updated inside the component
+ When do we re-render our application? 
when we change the state inside of our application
+ What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
use state to store date that are inside of a form like checkbox, textbox, or an input element that are being updated by the user.
