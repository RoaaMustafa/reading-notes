# Class-01 Code 201
From the Duckett HTML book:


 1. Introduction (pp.2-11)
+ HTML: is used to create web pages
+ CSS: uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages
+ When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.
+ All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

 2. HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
+ HTML pages are text documents.
+ HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
+ Tags are often referred to as elements.
+ Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
+ Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
+ To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).</p>
<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>

 4. HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)
The`<header>` and `<footer>` elements can be used for:
  - The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
  - A header or footer for an individual`<article>` or `<section>` within the page.
`<nav>` element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.  
 `<article>` element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
 `<aside>` element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.
  `<section>` element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
  `<hgroup>` element is to group together a set of one or more `<h1> through <h6>`elements so that they are treated as one single heading.

 5. HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)
+ It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
+  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
+ Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
+ Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
+ You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
+ You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
